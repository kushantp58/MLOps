    "##### 3. Artifacts -> Artifacts consists of additional information that can be logged along with a run including model weights, model architecture, model predictions, model gradients and more.\n",
    "##### 4. Projects -> Come on, anyone can explain that but in short it's a way of organizing runs and experiments with each project having multiple runs and experiments.\n",
    "##### 5. Experiments -> Collection of runs sharing the same codebase, data and hyperparameters\n",
    "##### 6. Compare -> Compare is a feature that allows us to compare multiple runs and experiments in terms of their metrics and artifacts.\n",
    "##### 7. Dashboard -> A web based interface that allows us to view and explore runs, experiments and projects.\n",
    "##### 8. Integrations -> The flexibility of W&B allows us to blend it with different frameworks and libraries including PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, XGBoost for tracking training progress and logging experimental results.\n",
    "##### 9. Sweeps -> Sweeps allows to perform hyperparameter tuning and optmization of the model by running multiple experiments with different hyperparameters.\n",
    "##### 10. Notebooks -> W&B can track and monitor the progress of your jupyter notebooks and share the results with the rest of the team."
