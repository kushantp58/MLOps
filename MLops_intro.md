## Introduction to MLOps    
### What is MLOps?
##### MLOps also referred to as Machine Learning Operations, a method of combining software engineering and machine learning to improve speed, quality and reliability of machine learning models in production.

### Why do we need MLOps?
##### MLOPs invovle a set of techniques and tools for management of entire machine learning lifecycle from development to deployment and monitoring. 

##### 1. Scalability: The use of ml models in production is increasing day by day, hence the need for scalability is also increasing. This means we need a way for effective deployment and monitoring of these models.

##### 2. Speed: The scalability of models gives rise to the need for speed at which ML models can be deployed to production environments. MLOps helps streamlines some of the processes involved in this phase and speed up the time-to-market for an ML product.

##### 3. Quality, Reliability and Security: ML models can sometimes be very sensitive to changes in environment and produce unexpected outputs. These models are complex and hard to test and validated rendering them prone to errors thereby reducing quality and reliability. And lastly, with a lot of team collaboration, access privileges, data sharing and security becomes a major concern. MLOps helps in addressing these issues.
